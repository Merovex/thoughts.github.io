# Gun Death Statistics

There were 5,100 firearm-related murders in 2016, of the 30,000 total firearm-related homicides that year. There were nearly as many firearm-related justifiable homicides in 2016.

According to the [2017 Major Cities Chiefs Association](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/pdf/news/mcca_violent_crime_report_2017_and_2016_midyear_07312017_update.pdf) report, there were 2,994 firearm-related murders in 2016 in 62 reporting jurisdictions.

Left out of this report were the 335 murders that occurred in [New York city in 2016](https://projects.newsday.com/databases/long-island/new-york-city-crime-rate/), which exceeded Chicago. The table below includes those NYC murders, bringing the total reported murders in the 63 jurisdictions to 3329, or 2/3s of all murders. The top five strict firearms-law jurisdictions accounted for a quarter of all firearm-related murders. Listed below are the reported jurisdictions with more than 100 murders.

| City            | Murders       | Percent of Total |
| -------------   | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Baltimore**   | 137   | 2.6%  |
| **Chicago**     | 328   | 6.4%   |
| **Detroit**     | 140   | 2.7%  |
| Houston         | 158   | 3.1%  |
| **Los Angeles** | 245   | 4.8%  |
| **New York City** | 335 | 6.5% |
| Philadelphia    | 122   | 2.2%  |
| Total           | 1465  | 28%  |
| Strict-Laws     | 1185  | 23%  |



<!-- But what about other deaths each year?
* 52,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
* 36,000 people die per year from the flu or the flu vaccine, far exceeding gun deaths
* 38,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities, again exceeding gun deaths

Now it gets good:
* 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! A 15% reduction in medical errors would equal the total gun deaths...... Simple, easy, and preventable ...15% reductions!
* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburger super-size!
* In 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions -->
