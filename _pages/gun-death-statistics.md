There are 30,000 gun-related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: What % of the population dies from gun-related actions each year? That answer is 0.00926%. While sad, statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:
* 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws
* 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified
* 3% are accidental (negligent) discharge deaths
* 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug-related or mentally ill persons – gun violence

So technically, "gun violence" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?
* 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago (updated-665 in 2017)
* 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore
* 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit
* 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)

A quarter of all gun violence crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.
This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.

Now, who has the strictest gun laws? California, of course, so it is not the lack of gun laws. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states.
So, if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the violence.

Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of the crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.

But what about other deaths each year?
* 52,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
* 36,000 people die per year from the flu or the flu vaccine, far exceeding gun deaths
* 38,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities, again exceeding gun deaths

Now it gets good:
* 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! A 15% reduction in medical errors would equal the total gun deaths...... Simple, easy, and preventable ...15% reductions!
* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburger super-size!
* In 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions
