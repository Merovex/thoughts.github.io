# Gun Death Statistics

According to the [2017 Major Cities Chiefs Association](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/pdf/news/mcca_violent_crime_report_2017_and_2016_midyear_07312017_update.pdf) report, there were 2,994 gun-related murders in 2016, where greater than a third occurred in six cities (listed are those with greater than 100 murders in 2016).

| City  | Murders | Percent of Total |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Baltimore     | 137  | 4.5%  |
| Chicago       | 328  | 11%   |
| Detroit       | 140  | 4.6%  |
| Houston       | 158  | 5.2%  |
| Los Angeles   | 245  | 8.1%  |
| Philadelphia  | 122  | 4.1%  |
| Total         | 1130 | 37.5%  |


A quarter of all gun violence crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.
This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.

Now, who has the strictest gun laws? California, of course, so it is not the lack of gun laws. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states.
So, if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the violence.

Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of the crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.

But what about other deaths each year?
* 52,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
* 36,000 people die per year from the flu or the flu vaccine, far exceeding gun deaths
* 38,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities, again exceeding gun deaths

Now it gets good:
* 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! A 15% reduction in medical errors would equal the total gun deaths...... Simple, easy, and preventable ...15% reductions!
* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburger super-size!
* In 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions
