# Gun Death Statistics

According to the [2017 Major Cities Chiefs Association](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/pdf/news/mcca_violent_crime_report_2017_and_2016_midyear_07312017_update.pdf) report, there were 2,994 gun-related murders in 2016, where greater than a third occurred in six cities (listed are those with greater than 100 murders in 2016). More than a quarter occur in four cities with the strictest gun-laws.

| City            | Murders       | Percent of Total |
| -------------   | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Baltimore**   | 137  | 4.5%  |
| **Chicago**     | 328  | 11%   |
| **Detroit**     | 140  | 4.6%  |
| Houston         | 158  | 5.2%  |
| **Los Angeles** | 245  | 8.1%  |
| Philadelphia    | 122  | 4.1%  |
| Total           | 1130 | 37.5%  |
| Strict-Laws     | 850  | 28.4%  |

<!-- But what about other deaths each year?
* 52,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
* 36,000 people die per year from the flu or the flu vaccine, far exceeding gun deaths
* 38,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities, again exceeding gun deaths

Now it gets good:
* 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! A 15% reduction in medical errors would equal the total gun deaths...... Simple, easy, and preventable ...15% reductions!
* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburger super-size!
* In 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions -->
